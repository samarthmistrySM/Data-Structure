# Stack Implementation in JavaScript

## Overview

This is a basic implementation of a stack data structure in JavaScript. A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.

## Methods

### isEmpty(arr)

*   Checks if the stack is empty.
*   Returns `true` if the stack is empty, `false` otherwise.

### peek(arr)

*   Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
*   If the stack is empty, returns `undefined`.

### pop(arr)

*   Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
*   If the stack is empty, returns `undefined`.

### printStack(arr)

*   Prints the elements of the stack in the order they were added.
*   Returns a string representation of the stack.

### push(arr, element)

*   Adds a new element to the top of the stack.
*   Modifies the original array.

### size(arr)

*   Returns the number of elements in the stack.

## Usage

To use these functions, require the modules and call the desired functions in the file `index.js` with the appropriate arguments and Run this command. 

#### Command:
```bash
node index.js
```
